The clinical trials of COMBOGESIC have been conducted in patients with postoperative pain following dental and arthroscopic procedures, who received double-blind treatment every 6 hours for 24 or 48 hours. Most commonly (≥2%) reported adverse reactions by organ system during double-blind treatment are listed in the table below. Adverse reactions are closely related to the extent (the level and length) of exposure. The incidences of overall and individual adverse reactions reported during the double-blind treatment period did not suggest an increase of risks associated with short-term (up to one or two days) use of the combination drug, COMBOGESIC in comparison to each individual component, acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and to placebo.

      "drugInteractions": [
        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with COMBOGESIC Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Ibuprofen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of ibuprofen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of COMBOGESIC with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ]. Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Intervention: Concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. COMBOGESIC is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 and 5.6) ]. Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of ibuprofen with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance . The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDS and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of ibuprofen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Intervention: The concomitant use of ibuprofen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDS and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of COMBOGESIC and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration. A number of known or potential interactions between COMBOGESIC and other drugs/drug classes exist. Please refer to the Drug Interactions section ( 7 ) for further information."

      "clinicalPharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Analgesia COMBOGESIC contains acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic. The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to primarily involve central actions. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its mechanism of action for analgesia, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ibuprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hematological Effects NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Peak plasma concentration following the administration of three COMBOGESIC tablets occurs at approximately 45 minutes and 1 hour 15 minutes after administration for acetaminophen and ibuprofen, respectively, under fasting condition. In the same study, the peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the extent of absorption (AUC 0-inf ) are 14.88 mcg/mL and 47.44 mcg.h/mL for acetaminophen and 25.58 mcg/mL and 95.62 mcg.h/mL for ibuprofen, respectively. The C max and AUC 0-inf values for both acetaminophen and ibuprofen increase dose proportionally to increases in COMBOGESIC doses from one, to two, to three tablets. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study of COMBOGESIC in volunteers showed no drug interactions between acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Food effects When COMBOGESIC was administered with food, the time to peak plasma concentration was delayed by approximately 30 minutes for acetaminophen and was approximately the same when compared to fasting conditions for ibuprofen. The peak plasma concentration of acetaminophen was reduced by approximately 30%, but the extent of absorption was not affected. Peak plasma concentration and the extent of absorption were not affected for ibuprofen. Distribution Acetaminophen appears to be widely distributed throughout most body tissues except fat. Its apparent volume of distribution is about 0.9 L/kg. A relatively small portion (~20%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma protein. Elimination The half-life of acetaminophen is about 2 to 3 hours in adults. It is somewhat shorter in children and somewhat longer in neonates and in cirrhotic patients. Acetaminophen is eliminated from the body primarily by formation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in a dose-dependent manner. Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. The elimination half-life of ibuprofen is in the range of 1.9 to 2.2 hours. Metabolism Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways: a) conjugation with glucuronide; b) conjugation with sulfate; and c) oxidation via the cytochrome, P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form a reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways. In adults, the majority of acetaminophen is conjugated with glucuronic acid and, to a lesser extent, with sulfate. These glucuronide-, sulfate-, and glutathione-derived metabolites lack biologic activity. In premature infants, newborns, and young infants, the sulfate conjugate predominates. Excretion Less than 9% of acetaminophen is excreted unchanged in the urine. The excretion of ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. Studies have shown that following ingestion of ibuprofen 45% to 79% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as metabolite A (25%), (+)-2-[p-(2hydroxymethyl-propyl) phenyl]propionic acid and metabolite B (37%), (+)-2-[p-(2carboxypropyl)phenyl]propionic acid; the percentages of free and conjugated ibuprofen were approximately 1% and 14%, respectively. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of COMBOGESIC has not been studied in pediatric patients below 18 years of age. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of COMBOGESIC in patients with impaired hepatic function has not been studied [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of COMBOGESIC in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin: When ibuprofen is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ibuprofen is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Ibuprofen Use of NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of COMBOGESIC use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation and avoid COMBOGESIC use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations , Data ). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Use of NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimester of pregnancy are inconclusive. In published animal reproduction studies, there were no clear developmental effects at doses up to 2.7-times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) in the rabbit and 1.5-times in the MHDD rat when dosed throughout gestation. In contrast, an increase in membranous ventricular septal defects was reported in rats treated on Gestation Days 9 & 10 with 2.2-times the MHDD. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as ibuprofen, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. Acetaminophen Prolonged experience with acetaminophen in pregnant women over several decades, based on published observational epidemiological studies and case reports, did not identify a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and mice from the published literature have identified adverse events at clinically relevant doses of acetaminophen. Fetotoxicity, increases in bone variations in the fetuses, and necrosis in the fetus liver and kidney have been noted in studies in rats. In mice treated with acetaminophen at doses within the clinical dosing range, cumulative adverse effects on reproduction were seen in a continuous breeding study. A reduction in number of litters of the parental mating pair was observed as well as retarded growth and abnormal sperm in their offspring and reduced birth weight in the next generation. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC, in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data ) . Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If, after consideration of alternative treatments for pain management, an NSAID-containing product, including COMBOGESIC, is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If COMBOGESIC treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue COMBOGESIC and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of COMBOGESIC during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Data Human Data Ibuprofen: Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Acetaminophen: The results from a large population-based prospective cohort, including data from 26,424 women with live born singletons who were exposed to oral acetaminophen during the first trimester, indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations, compared to a control group of unexposed children. The rate of congenital malformations (4.3%) was similar to the rate in the general population. A population-based, case-control study from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study showed that 11,610 children with prenatal exposure to acetaminophen during the first trimester had no increased risk of major birth defects compared to 4,500 children in the control group. Other epidemiological data showed similar results. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including recall bias. Animal Data Ibuprofen: In a published study, female rabbits given 7.5, 20, or 60 mg/kg ibuprofen (0.12, 0.33, or 0.99-times the maximum human daily dose of 1170 mg of ibuprofen based on a body surface area comparison) from Gestation Days 1 to 29, no clear treatment-related adverse developmental effects were noted. This dose was associated with significant maternal toxicity (stomach ulcers, gastric lesions). In the same publication, female rats were administered 7.5, 20, 60, 180 mg/kg ibuprofen (0.06, 0.17, 0.50, 1.5-times the maximum daily dose) did not result in clear adverse developmental effects. Maternal toxicity (gastrointestinal lesions) was noted at 20 mg/kg and above. In a published study, rats were orally dosed with 300 mg/kg ibuprofen (2.5-times the maximum human daily dose of 1170 mg based on a body surface area comparison) during Gestation Days 9 and 10 (critical time points for heart development in rats). Ibuprofen treatment resulted in an increase in the incidence of membranous ventricular septal defects. This dose was associated with significant maternal toxicity including gastrointestinal toxicity. One incidence each of a membranous ventricular septal defect and gastroschisis was noted fetuses from rabbits treated with 500 mg/kg (8.3-times the maximum human daily dose) from Gestation Day 9 to 11. Acetaminophen: Studies in pregnant rats that received oral acetaminophen during organogenesis at doses up to 0.87-times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD = 3.9 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison) showed evidence of fetotoxicity (reduced fetal weight and length) and a dose-related increase in bone variations (reduced ossification and rudimentary rib changes). Offspring had no evidence of external, visceral, or skeletal malformations. When pregnant rats received oral acetaminophen throughout gestation at doses of 1.2-times the MHDD (based on a body surface area comparison), areas of necrosis occurred in both the liver and kidney of pregnant rats and fetuses. These effects did not occur in animals that received oral acetaminophen at doses 0.3-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison. In a continuous breeding study, pregnant mice received 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0% acetaminophen via the diet (357, 715, or 1430 mg/kg/day). These doses are approximately 0.45, 0.89, and 1.8 times the MHDD, respectively, based on a body surface area comparison. A dose-related reduction in body weights of fourth and fifth litter offspring of the treated mating pair occurred during lactation and post-weaning at all doses. Animals in the high dose group had a reduced number of litters per mating pair, male offspring with an increased percentage of abnormal sperm, and reduced birth weights in the next generation pups."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 )]. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."
